-Update Report
-Plan out the logic of the assignment and code
-Read Feedback
-Clean the data(probably not - explain why in report)
-Investigate ways of visualising the data i.e. plot a classification boundary diagram
-Plot a logistic regression graph
-Plot a cost function graph
-Use/plot decision function on training function
-Create models for at least 3 models i.e. one with all, then with first half, then with second half

///////////////////////////
Model 1: LogisticReg(xClassified, yClassified), Plot [too many points to plot]
Model 2: LogisticReg(AVG(xClassified.transposed), yClassified), Plot [AVG, yClassified]
Model 3: LogisticReg(AVG(xClassified.transposed [+/*] wavelength), yClassified), Plot [AVGExtra, yClassified]



NOTE:
- ALWAYS CHECK THE DIMENSIONS OF DATA BEING USED FOR EACH MODEL
--You might need to transpose a few
